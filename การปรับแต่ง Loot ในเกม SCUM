# SCUM Loot Customization Guide

## Introduction

This document explains the customization of loot in the game SCUM. Loot customization is done through creating and modifying various JSON files. Basic knowledge of JSON is essential. If you're unfamiliar with JSON or need a refresher, here are some helpful links:

- [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
- [W3Schools JSON Intro](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
- [JSON.org](https://json.org/)

Most JSON files related to loot can be exported from the game via various admin commands, while some files need to be created manually. The main paths where JSON files are found are:

- Multiplayer server: `<Server>\SCUM\Saved\Config\WindowsServer\Loot`
- Single-player mode: `%LocalAppData%\SCUM\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\Loot`

JSON files are loaded when the game starts, and any changes can be reloaded via the `#ReloadLootCustomizationsAndResetSpawners` command for quick testing of modifications. This command and the processes of exporting, creating, and modifying JSON files related to loot will be explained later. Before diving into commands and loot modifications, we will cover the basic concepts and features necessary for effective loot customization.

If you want to start immediately, go to the [Export Section](#export-section).

## Rarity

Rarity is used throughout loot customization to determine the likelihood of selecting an object from a set of objects. An object is an abstract term and can mean anything. You can think of an object as a temporary item. Each object in a set is assigned a rarity which can be one of the following values:

- **Abundant:** 32 times more likely to be selected than Extremely Rare
- **Common:** 16 times more likely to be selected than Extremely Rare
- **Uncommon:** 8 times more likely to be selected than Extremely Rare
- **Rare:** 4 times more likely to be selected than Extremely Rare
- **Very Rare:** 2 times more likely to be selected than Extremely Rare
- **Extremely Rare:** equally likely to be selected as other Extremely Rare objects in the set

For example, the following set of objects (objects in this example are items):

```json
{ Apple (Abundant), Banana (Common), Lemon (Uncommon), Kiwi (Rare), Mango (Very Rare), Watermelon (Extremely Rare) }
